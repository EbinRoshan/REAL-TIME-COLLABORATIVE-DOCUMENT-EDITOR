*DESCRIPTION:*

This file is the foundation or main entry point for a modern web application — specifically, a Real-time Collaborative Document Editor. Even though the page itself looks almost empty, it's very important. Here's what it does:

It sets up the basic structure of the webpage.

It loads the main JavaScript code from another file (/src/main.tsx) — which likely contains the real content and logic of the app.

The actual app is displayed inside the <div id="root"></div>. This is where the entire interface is "injected" using JavaScript.

It's built using modern web tools — most likely React with TypeScript and Vite.

Even though this file doesn’t contain visible content itself, it connects all the pieces that make the app work.

Now, here's a simple, user-friendly description of 6 pages this app would probably include:

1. Welcome Page (Home)
This is where new users land. It’s a friendly introduction to the app with a message like:
“Start working with your team in real-time.”
You might see a big "Get Started" button and a quick list of features.

2. Login / Sign-up Page
Before you can edit anything, you’ll need to log in or create an account. This page asks for your email and password, or lets you sign in with Google.

3. Dashboard Page
Once you're logged in, you’ll see your Dashboard. It shows all your documents in one place. You can open a document, start a new one, or see documents shared with you.

4. Document Editor Page
This is the heart of the app. It looks like a clean writing area, similar to Google Docs. You and your teammates can all write, edit, and see each other's changes instantly.

5. Document History Page
Want to go back in time? This page shows the history of changes made to a document. You can look at previous versions and see who did what — super helpful if someone accidentally deletes something.

6. Settings or Profile Page
This is where you control your account. Change your name, profile picture, password, or notification preferences. You can also connect your Google Drive or manage your subscription here.
